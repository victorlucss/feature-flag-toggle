# FF Toggle

This is a **study repository** (please don't judge haha) focusing in implement Feature Flags in an easy way (enable and disable it). Since it is study only maybe I'll abandon this as I did with my other side projects ðŸ˜Œ

### Things on this repo

- **/api** - The Feature Flag API  
- **/ff-toggle-sdk** - The Feature Flag React SDK (mainly the `FFToggleContext`, that will be what I expected to export and be the real SDK, the App.js is an example of the FF working)
- **/playground** - A Node environment to test the events on API Socket, I'll use this, for instance, to test the socket authentication or something like that

### Brainstorm

So let's see which things a tool that manages FF need?

- [ ] Sure, enable and disable the FF
- [ ] Make the above thing be real time
- [ ] Have a SDK and, for that, must need a API_KEY or something like that to protect requests
- [ ] Of course, it need to have some security, as a limit of request/minute
- [ ] Rollout strategy
- [ ] Maybe events? don't know if it's needed, but since we're here why not?
- [ ] After while, the tool need to have some user's managing tool
- [ ] Don't know, may you help me with that? contribuuute :)


What a feature flag need to be created? 

- Name
- Key (generated by name)
- Value (it must be JSON friendly)
- Active
